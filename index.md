<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 14px;">I am a research scientist at the [Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7).</span> <span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 14px;">Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from </span>[<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 14px; color: blue;">Vanderbilt University</span>](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/)<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 14px;">, where I was advised by [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/). I graduated with B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I interned at Apple Inc. in 2017 and at Max Planck Institute in 2011.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 14px;">My research interests span computational game theory, stochastic planning, machine learning and artificial intelligence. At present, I am exploring algorithmic fairness in machine learning.</span>
