I am a research scientist at the [Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs(https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7)]. Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Vanderbilt University](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/), where I was advised by</span> [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/)<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 16px;">. I graduated with B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from</span> [<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 16px; color: red;">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</span>](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EE)<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 16px;">. I interned at Apple Inc. in 2017 and at </span> [<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 16px; color: red;">Max Planck Institute</span>](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/csc)<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 16px;"> in 2011.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 16px;">My research interests span algorithmic fairness, machine learning, stochastic planning and computational game theory. </span>
