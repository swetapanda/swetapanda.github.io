<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 15px;">I am a research scientist at the [Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7).</span><span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 15px;">Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Vanderbilt University](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/), where I was advised by [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/). I graduated with B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I was an intern at Apple Inc. in 2017 and at MPI Magdeburg in 2011.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'verdana'; font-size: 15px;">My research interests span computational game theory, stochastic planning, machine learning and artificial intelligence. At present, I am exploring algorithmic fairness in machine learning.</span>
