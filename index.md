I am a research scientist at the [<span style="color:blue">Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs</span>](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7). Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [<span style="color:blue">Vanderbilt University</span>](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/), where I was advised by [<span style="color:blue">Yevgeniy Vorobeychik</span>](http://vorobeychik.com/). I graduated with B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from [<span style="color:blue">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</span>](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EE). I interned at Apple Inc. in 2017 and at  [<span style="color:blue">Max Planck Institute<\span>](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/csc) in 2011.

My research interests span algorithmic fairness, machine learning, stochastic planning and computational game theory.
